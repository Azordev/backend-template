# GIT USE:

There are some rules that apply when interacting with the project repository. This will allow us to have a standard that any developer can understand. It is important to comply with these rules so that the linting tool allows us to use the repository.

**Branch:**

Every time an issue is assigned to you, you must create a new branch. This can be done through the command:

```
git branch <name of branch>
```

For convenience, the branches should have a defined structure. For example, if the issue is about adding a new feature, the branch should be:

```
feature/#issue number-brief-description-of-the-feature
```

Suppose we have issue #12 that asks us to add a header to the main page. Then, the branch would be as follows:

```
feature/#12-add-header-to-main-page
```

If it is about solving a bug, we just have to put the word "fix" in front of it. For example:

```
fix/#14-remove-bad-media-queries-in-rating-component
```

**Commits:**

Like branches, commits must also follow a format. Notice how the commit message varies if it is a feature or a bug fix.

**feat**: added header to main page

**fix**: removed bad media queries in rating component

**Pull Request (PR):**

The PRâ€™s are requests that as developers we make once the solution of an issue is completed and we want the code to be integrated into the master branch of the project. Before that, we must ensure that our code is fully functional and adhering to best practices.

Once we have done a commit & push in our branch, a notification with a yellow background will appear in the github repository and will ask us to continue with the PR. In the TextArea to perform the PR you will find several sections that you want to complete: A brief description of what you did, a snapshot (if applicable), the tasks that were completed and the steps to view them.
